00:00:19,02 --> 00:00:21,22
Hello and welcome to this episode of talk the talk.

2
00:00:21,99 --> 00:00:27,08
Show about linguistics the science of language for the next hour we're going to be bringing you language news language

3
00:00:27,09 --> 00:00:27,63
acquisition

4
00:00:27,95 --> 00:00:33,83
and some great music maybe we'll even hear from you my name's Daniel Midgley I'm here with Good Morning on this episode

5
00:00:33,84 --> 00:00:36,71
we're talking about the amazing things that babies

6
00:00:36,91 --> 00:00:42,42
and children know about language their linguistic super geniuses they show amazing powers for not to live their own

7
00:00:42,43 --> 00:00:48,53
language but also others and we're going to find out what helps them learn this episode of the time.

8
00:00:51,70 --> 00:00:56,60
I'm going into babies I've had one I can say it really confidently now babies

9
00:00:56,61 --> 00:01:00,88
and not MY JAM I did not think that I was going to like babies because they're messy and they smell

10
00:01:00,89 --> 00:01:04,05
but I just always like them to say it's not the messy

11
00:01:04,06 --> 00:01:08,35
and the smell think there's plenty of things in my life that are messy and smell myself very much included

12
00:01:08,93 --> 00:01:13,69
and I love myself. Not just bowl arena.

13
00:01:16,08 --> 00:01:17,45
Once you get under the hood

14
00:01:17,46 --> 00:01:21,84
and figure out what they're thinking they become instantly into anything they just blobs

15
00:01:22,11 --> 00:01:28,27
when they start thinking things I've got a toddler now all men everyone's like oh look out for the like terrible threes

16
00:01:28,69 --> 00:01:36,16
not a thing I don't love and day is just so much fun like. What it is like.

17
00:01:37,01 --> 00:01:38,63
To come in then we're going to hide from wants to

18
00:01:38,64 --> 00:01:45,11
and it's so much fun let's say hi to Kylie who's probably listening right now from under a stack of books sup colleague

19
00:01:45,12 --> 00:01:49,66
his colleagues the sort of diligent person who will absolutely listen to this when she's not on the show

20
00:01:49,80 --> 00:01:52,38
but honestly not like that.

21
00:01:53,34 --> 00:01:58,71
Why don't we talk about what's going on in the world of linguistics in the week and there's been so much going on

22
00:01:58,72 --> 00:02:04,65
but you know what I want to keep it to child language acquisition because there's been a lot of stuff that's going on

23
00:02:04,66 --> 00:02:05,23
in Baby

24
00:02:05,24 --> 00:02:12,04
and Child language news since the last time we talked about this I think sometime last year it upon me number one

25
00:02:12,54 --> 00:02:22,35
babies recognize foreign languages as language OK so what I'm picking up here is you got a baby yeah this is

26
00:02:22,36 --> 00:02:23,73
when they were about a year old

27
00:02:23,74 --> 00:02:28,62
and they're they've already got a solid footing in what their language is going to be so I'm assuming some F.M.R.I.

28
00:02:29,00 --> 00:02:31,02
Happens they measure the baby's brain

29
00:02:31,03 --> 00:02:35,99
when it's hearing its own language that has a solid footing they go OK that's what listening to a bit of language

30
00:02:36,00 --> 00:02:39,90
sounds like let me stop you right there some language uses F.M.R.

31
00:02:40,16 --> 00:02:42,93
Eyes and we're going to take an extended look at one project that does

32
00:02:43,11 --> 00:02:45,97
but do you know how difficult it is to get a child into an M.R.I.

33
00:02:46,30 --> 00:02:50,44
Machine you can't move yet but I assume they just bolted the.

34
00:02:51,75 --> 00:02:56,68
Is that not it is that other things scientists can do I'm so glad you're not in this field.

35
00:02:57,52 --> 00:03:01,06
I didn't you I genuinely thought because they give ephemera so like dogs

36
00:03:01,07 --> 00:03:09,58
and stuff so they train the dogs to stop moving really really OK so you go on pending a lot of my assumptions about

37
00:03:09,59 --> 00:03:15,11
what goes on with ephemera as I call him the Joint Chief of death for reason I figured you actually just got like I

38
00:03:15,12 --> 00:03:17,36
know you didn't into these things

39
00:03:17,73 --> 00:03:24,07
and just bolted down as far as the dogs they had to give them special training they were all good boys OK sorry they

40
00:03:24,08 --> 00:03:30,43
did not get an F. M.R.I. No there's other ways you have to test babies OK what you do is you check their eye case.

41
00:03:31,13 --> 00:03:37,84
Because they will look differently at things that they are familiar with then things that they're not familiar with the

42
00:03:37,85 --> 00:03:39,77
person in the not familiar what they'll be like going.

43
00:03:40,61 --> 00:03:45,62
And then you can measure how long they gaze at the thing or sometimes they turn their head

44
00:03:46,12 --> 00:03:53,70
or they suck faster on a dummy or their heart will increase so they stablish a baseline for the baby's OK in one way

45
00:03:53,71 --> 00:03:56,48
or another that's right we've footed language.

46
00:03:57,70 --> 00:03:59,78
Let's say English because you and I speak English

47
00:04:00,56 --> 00:04:07,41
and then they give the baby presuming some like nonsense garbled noise I don't mean French I just nonsense actual

48
00:04:07,42 --> 00:04:08,68
nonsense gabble noise.

49
00:04:10,03 --> 00:04:14,67
And they kind of look at that response and OK so that's what know what language looks like

50
00:04:14,71 --> 00:04:16,66
and then they give a foreign language

51
00:04:16,84 --> 00:04:24,78
and the babies do the like so which response that is correct this is Athena Volo monoliths of N.Y.U.

52
00:04:24,99 --> 00:04:26,16
Is Department of Psychology

53
00:04:26,17 --> 00:04:34,85
and team they showed the babies these infants a video of a communicator trying to reach an object

54
00:04:35,84 --> 00:04:43,63
but the communicator couldn't reach it so the communicator had to say something to someone else as if to say hey give

55
00:04:43,64 --> 00:04:51,22
me that object. Juice OK sometimes it was in their native language English sometimes it was in.

56
00:04:51,29 --> 00:04:58,72
Spanish or russian better sounds different Russian is structured different but sometimes it was just in humming.

57
00:05:01,18 --> 00:05:11,03
Now where would the babies look longer longest surely is is their own language is already sees English I'm thinking

58
00:05:11,37 --> 00:05:17,73
foreign languages then humming Yeah babies looked at a long time when there was a foreign language spoken and

59
00:05:17,74 --> 00:05:23,67
when the communicator on the videotape was humming they just didn't seem to care about of their own Now I wonder if you

60
00:05:23,68 --> 00:05:28,12
could hum in such a way that would mimic cadence and pole is in because because

61
00:05:28,13 --> 00:05:36,07
when I hum I just know how many months and. I guess humming would preserve the international contour.

62
00:05:37,30 --> 00:05:42,72
Yeah that's true yeah actually maybe you're right maybe babies are just like super geniuses what else is in the news

63
00:05:43,44 --> 00:05:51,70
signed languages signed languages always a fave babies recognize sign languages as language so was this the same study

64
00:05:51,71 --> 00:05:57,12
or a different study different study this one from rainbows worth a psychologist at the University of California San

65
00:05:57,13 --> 00:06:04,17
Diego they showed infants signs in sign language these were children who had not been exposed to sign language before

66
00:06:04,18 --> 00:06:09,88
they showed finger spelling somebody finger spelt well and then someone finger spelt sloppily

67
00:06:10,10 --> 00:06:14,72
but they showed these signs pre-linguistic infants and then they showed them to one year olds

68
00:06:15,62 --> 00:06:20,22
and there's a difference between these kids absolutely because the one year olds have committed to the language they're

69
00:06:20,23 --> 00:06:22,12
going to be speaking as the infants haven't

70
00:06:22,56 --> 00:06:28,94
and they found that the tiny babies watched the signs twenty percent more than the one year old children because the

71
00:06:28,95 --> 00:06:30,20
one year olds why.

72
00:06:32,21 --> 00:06:33,74
Are you doing some stuff with the hands

73
00:06:33,75 --> 00:06:38,91
and a lot of what I've been picking up is people doing stuff with their mouth so that's it like I like what you've got

74
00:06:38,92 --> 00:06:43,68
going on there but quite frankly it's not going on with the mouth right now and so.

75
00:06:45,23 --> 00:06:51,30
We're going to do yeah well this is actually kind of interesting because in previous studies it's been shown that the.

76
00:06:51,43 --> 00:06:59,27
Any babies can distinguish between the sounds of every sound in all the world's languages tiny babies can distinguish

77
00:06:59,28 --> 00:07:05,36
between the different sounds in all of the was languages so even the really subtle ones yes.

78
00:07:06,24 --> 00:07:11,84
And the how do we know that the reason we know this is because you give babies it OK now we're going way back to see a

79
00:07:11,85 --> 00:07:15,67
landmark work you give them a dummy OK and they suck on the dummy

80
00:07:16,07 --> 00:07:22,86
and inside the dummy as a counter to show how often they sucked and for tiny tiny babies if you give them a turn

81
00:07:22,92 --> 00:07:24,10
and they keep hearing.

82
00:07:25,30 --> 00:07:31,90
They start sucking and then eventually they get bored so they suck less then you swap the sound right.

83
00:07:35,45 --> 00:07:36,44
Those tiny babies

84
00:07:36,45 --> 00:07:43,99
when you swap from to belt they'll suck fast again yeah all eyes were really interesting things going on whereas if you

85
00:07:44,00 --> 00:07:46,57
do the same thing for a one year old

86
00:07:47,12 --> 00:07:55,96
and their language doesn't have a contrast they want to notice so once again the tiny infants are still just so almost

87
00:07:56,77 --> 00:08:01,59
flabbergasted by all the different possibilities right that they just everything's new everything's interesting

88
00:08:01,60 --> 00:08:07,61
everything's that they don't have any landmarks yet to go on right like the one year olds can look at people doing

89
00:08:07,62 --> 00:08:09,06
stuff with their hands and be like.

90
00:08:09,78 --> 00:08:13,71
I'm pretty sure that's not actually a thing that's part of the thing that I need to pay attention to

91
00:08:13,85 --> 00:08:19,39
but tiny babies just like well some of the sense well bone is doing something with the mouth was whole everything is

92
00:08:19,40 --> 00:08:25,51
news iris so human from if you look whereas by the time they get to be one year old they've kind of settled into a

93
00:08:25,52 --> 00:08:31,08
groove with the language they're going to speak and that's true for sounds but it's equally true for signs and

94
00:08:31,09 --> 00:08:34,30
when they hit three you can say the name over and over again

95
00:08:34,31 --> 00:08:39,51
but if it's the tone of voice that says it's both time they will just not pay attention whatsoever I'll try to remember

96
00:08:39,52 --> 00:08:40,87
that when I hit the first.

97
00:08:41,65 --> 00:08:48,55
In the meantime let's take a track on this one is one by tourist kid this one is learn on RTRFM 92.1.

98
00:08:51,48 --> 00:08:57,81
Welcome back to talk the talk weekly exploration of linguistics the science of language Ben

99
00:08:57,82 --> 00:09:06,03
and Daniel with the third musketeer is away this week I'm sure she's listening with sub dog hey this week we are

100
00:09:06,04 --> 00:09:10,07
talking about one of the things that is absent to Daniel

101
00:09:10,08 --> 00:09:18,76
and I as a father this kid language what is it that helps kids learn language most in your opinion based on everything

102
00:09:18,77 --> 00:09:26,12
we've talked about based on a lot of shows we've done on child language I don't have a lot of experience with kids who

103
00:09:26,13 --> 00:09:28,52
have difficulty picking up language

104
00:09:28,95 --> 00:09:34,64
and so I don't want to make any broad generalizations I guess we are talking about neuro typical kids right

105
00:09:34,65 --> 00:09:43,57
but on the front My very much my approach which is kind of spilled out of my approach of observing mums is just like

106
00:09:44,15 --> 00:09:50,32
chill All right so don't worry about everyone chip it's going to happen it's all just going to kind of work out in the

107
00:09:50,33 --> 00:09:57,16
wash that is true although some people are more verbal talented like I was one of these intensely verbal kids I also

108
00:09:57,17 --> 00:10:05,07
was as well but everybody learns a language unless there's a very very good reason not to like lack of input

109
00:10:05,11 --> 00:10:07,48
or brain structure differently or

110
00:10:07,52 --> 00:10:15,09
or in Australia's case you get beaten every time you use your language Yeah that's a good point however there are some

111
00:10:15,10 --> 00:10:22,55
things that help people have done a lot of work figuring out what it is that is a good predictor of language skill.

112
00:10:23,26 --> 00:10:30,72
And I got to talk to somebody just like that her name is Rachel Romeo of MIT Now one thing that I kept hearing about

113
00:10:30,73 --> 00:10:37,74
for many decades was something called the thirty million word gap the thirty million word gap used to be the people

114
00:10:37,75 --> 00:10:40,29
thought that kids learned language best if they got tons

115
00:10:40,30 --> 00:10:45,65
and tons of input they thought that if there was more words being sort of thrown at these kids they were acquire

116
00:10:45,66 --> 00:10:51,45
language better and be so why why the thirty million number one it goes back to us.

117
00:10:51,94 --> 00:10:58,91
Rachel talks about where kids who were learning language better maybe if they were in a better social economic bracket

118
00:10:59,27 --> 00:11:04,98
then they would hear more words that's interesting well Rachel

119
00:11:04,99 --> 00:11:08,39
and her team began to question this thirty million word gap thing

120
00:11:08,40 --> 00:11:14,08
and they found something amazing in their work they found I'm going to spill the beans here means feeling that the

121
00:11:14,09 --> 00:11:22,18
number of words heard by the child was not a good predictor of language success Ainsley is riding. D.D.P.

122
00:11:23,63 --> 00:11:33,18
To instead what seems to help is the number of turns Yeah you know what that makes a lot of sense to me the backs

123
00:11:33,19 --> 00:11:40,07
and forth of language so you know I say something you say something back that's a turn so I decided to ask Rachel Romeo

124
00:11:40,08 --> 00:11:46,69
about it I wanted to ask about where this idea of the thirty million word gap came from so this was born out of this

125
00:11:46,73 --> 00:11:51,74
seminal study in the ninety's by Betty Hart I Brizzly and can bet

126
00:11:52,19 --> 00:11:59,78
and they were sort of pushing back against the need of it ideals of linguistics that said you know language is innate

127
00:11:59,82 --> 00:12:03,83
How could incense possibly learn language that wasn't just born into them

128
00:12:04,18 --> 00:12:08,42
and they said yeah there's probably some some structures going on in the brain

129
00:12:08,43 --> 00:12:15,63
but there is definitely an affective input and so they follow forty two families over the course of two

130
00:12:15,64 --> 00:12:23,30
and a half years of these children's lives and found that there were striking differences in between families

131
00:12:23,52 --> 00:12:28,77
and how much the children knew about language their vocabulary sizes and their I.Q.

132
00:12:29,15 --> 00:12:37,16
In general threat though in how much their families talked to them so the kids who had better vocabularies also had

133
00:12:37,56 --> 00:12:39,44
parents who talked to them a lot more

134
00:12:39,84 --> 00:12:48,48
and so this input output hypothesis came about that your language skill is directly related to how much you're talk to

135
00:12:48,80 --> 00:12:55,48
and unfortunately in fact the sound bite that everyone remembers from this study is just this purely quantitative

136
00:12:55,49 --> 00:13:01,79
measure of more words spoken equals more words known and certainly that's part of the story

137
00:13:01,80 --> 00:13:08,74
but more recently people have started to remember the other great big part of their study which was that it's not just

138
00:13:08,78 --> 00:13:11,06
about the sheer quantity of input

139
00:13:11,07 --> 00:13:20,43
but also about the quality of the end put so these families were who for their children were also using a larger

140
00:13:20,44 --> 00:13:24,38
variety of words so we call that lexical diversity.

141
00:13:24,42 --> 00:13:33,16
They were using more difficult where so at rare words more complicated words they were using more types of Syntactic

142
00:13:33,17 --> 00:13:42,75
Structures so grammatical complexity they were using more questions and affirmations instead of directives

143
00:13:42,80 --> 00:13:48,35
and negative statements and so all these qualitative aspects were intimately linked

144
00:13:48,73 --> 00:13:53,51
and over the last couple of decades since that study people have started to look more

145
00:13:53,52 --> 00:13:57,93
and say Hey mate it's actually the quality that matters more than the quantity

146
00:13:58,28 --> 00:14:02,31
and so that was one of the things we were interested in as well what are the X.X.

147
00:14:02,76 --> 00:14:07,05
Of children's language input that really drives their acquisition

148
00:14:07,29 --> 00:14:16,07
and one of the things that I seem to remember from all this was that a very glaring aspect of the study was the

149
00:14:16,08 --> 00:14:24,49
socioeconomic status that that really was tied to language development in part because parents who are well off do have

150
00:14:24,53 --> 00:14:32,70
more time to to give more input Yeah so one of the big takeaways from the heart rates like study was that the biggest

151
00:14:32,71 --> 00:14:41,39
predictor of which families talked more was their socioeconomic status so wealthier well to do families were giving

152
00:14:41,40 --> 00:14:49,51
their children a lot more language input than last well OP Amalie And so that what gave rise to this term the thirty

153
00:14:49,52 --> 00:14:55,86
million word gap was that the well off families were speaking to their children so much more and that

154
00:14:55,87 --> 00:15:02,19
when you aggregate that over the first four years of children's lives that amount into a gap in of almost thirty

155
00:15:02,20 --> 00:15:08,76
million where OK so that's where the research that until recently with the work done by you

156
00:15:08,77 --> 00:15:16,54
and your team can you tell me a little about what you decided to do what about the children who were your subjects did

157
00:15:16,55 --> 00:15:24,44
you study so we were really interested in at looking at the neural mechanisms underlying this input out.

158
00:15:24,53 --> 00:15:30,24
That relationship this relationship between the amount or the quality of children language

159
00:15:30,25 --> 00:15:37,23
and put them linked to their language skills their academic achievement their own life trajectories over and over

160
00:15:37,24 --> 00:15:38,08
and over again

161
00:15:38,31 --> 00:15:44,54
but any time we see a behavioral link like that there's got to be a neural mechanism environment's got to change the

162
00:15:44,55 --> 00:15:52,05
brain and then the brains got to change behavior and so what we did is we looked at children and families

163
00:15:52,09 --> 00:15:55,44
and put them in brain scanners of functional M.R.I.

164
00:15:55,90 --> 00:15:57,10
Machine to try

165
00:15:57,11 --> 00:16:05,36
and understand across children what the individual differences in language input related to in terms of neural

166
00:16:05,37 --> 00:16:09,75
structure and function you must have had to train them to sit still in the F. M.R.I.

167
00:16:09,89 --> 00:16:13,50
Machine that is the trickiest part.

168
00:16:14,70 --> 00:16:16,99
After you have a little while

169
00:16:17,00 --> 00:16:25,19
and you know how they don't like to sit still especially we worked with preschool age children ages about four to five

170
00:16:25,20 --> 00:16:29,59
to six and they're just starting to learn how to that still

171
00:16:29,60 --> 00:16:36,64
but they're also very sensitive to rewards they're amazing that you can train them kind of you didn't hear me say this

172
00:16:36,65 --> 00:16:44,84
but you can kind of conditioned responses like like Pavlov's dad on the way he actually is we have a practice M.R.I.

173
00:16:45,08 --> 00:16:47,77
Scanner and they get to go in the practice M.R.I.

174
00:16:48,09 --> 00:16:51,19
and We put them with a movie they're watching a movie

175
00:16:51,55 --> 00:16:59,14
and we also have a motion sensitive camera so if they move more than a couple of millimeters we cut off their movie

176
00:16:59,53 --> 00:17:02,63
and so we try to train them just.

177
00:17:03,38 --> 00:17:12,44
To realize that hey if you're moving we're going to turn off the fun thing Oh man OK So you looked at their brains

178
00:17:12,45 --> 00:17:17,73
and while they were listening to language what did you find there yeah we looked at their brains while they were

179
00:17:17,77 --> 00:17:24,39
listening to some simple stories we just played them some fifteen second clips of things that kids are.

180
00:17:24,45 --> 00:17:25,90
No you're with like.

181
00:17:26,62 --> 00:17:32,37
Playing games or getting hurt or going to school or shopping and with your parents things like that

182
00:17:32,67 --> 00:17:38,38
and then we play the exact same clip backwards and so when we play the audio backwards

183
00:17:38,66 --> 00:17:41,41
and then compare the brain responses to forwards

184
00:17:41,42 --> 00:17:47,84
and backwards speech we sort of control for all those lower level audits where the processing characteristics

185
00:17:48,23 --> 00:17:56,41
and what we found is that all kids use a specific part of the braid known as varying Keys area that's involved

186
00:17:56,42 --> 00:18:03,11
and receptive language practicing across the board every kid was really using this part of the brain to process

187
00:18:03,16 --> 00:18:07,44
language but we saw a lot of individual did trance

188
00:18:07,73 --> 00:18:16,64
and the other major language part of the brain known as Broca's area the kids who had experienced more conversation in

189
00:18:16,65 --> 00:18:22,97
their environments used this part of the brain a lot more to process the language they were hearing

190
00:18:23,28 --> 00:18:29,27
and the kids who heard last conversation were using it a lot less Rachel Romeo from MIT

191
00:18:29,28 --> 00:18:35,46
and Harvard Ah I absolutely need a motion tracking camera that tends off a screen that is a thing that I need in my

192
00:18:35,47 --> 00:18:41,10
life that was my favorite really really really bad so it's just a brilliant way to get kids to stop moving elegant

193
00:18:41,11 --> 00:18:46,25
design solution and sort of cruel I love cruelty I love it so

194
00:18:46,26 --> 00:18:51,46
when they were listening to language there Verna he's area was working pretty much the same rut

195
00:18:51,80 --> 00:18:53,39
but they're broken Zakariya was

196
00:18:53,40 --> 00:18:58,88
and now you we've talked about Vernon he's an Broca's area Broca's I remember is the one that's really bad if you have

197
00:18:58,89 --> 00:19:04,81
a stroke that's basically the bit I remember it's been thought and I have taught in my classes that that's the one

198
00:19:04,82 --> 00:19:08,12
when you have a problem with Broca's area like a stroke

199
00:19:08,13 --> 00:19:13,93
or damage you can say stuff because it's involved in language production in fact we know the Broca's area is a little

200
00:19:13,94 --> 00:19:19,10
more complicated than that we talked a few shows ago about how when you've got people in an F. M.R.I.

201
00:19:19,23 --> 00:19:24,29
Machine and you've got to think about making tools Broca's area started letting up.

202
00:19:24,60 --> 00:19:30,12
So it's it's got it's like all the language every time we stick a person in the cheated death

203
00:19:30,13 --> 00:19:36,43
and we do language stuff it's just the answer always seems to come back. Kind of everywhere.

204
00:19:37,29 --> 00:19:37,93
That's the thing

205
00:19:38,12 --> 00:19:45,22
and that is because language piggybacked on existing structure yeah I don't think that we have a time

206
00:19:45,23 --> 00:19:53,26
when language suddenly evolved that you know he suddenly evolved a mutation that helped us process grammar Noam Chomsky

207
00:19:53,72 --> 00:19:58,76
Instead we were able to do stuff we had smart brains and then language kind of piled up about.

208
00:20:00,20 --> 00:20:04,34
We still need to get to the ten taking bits so why don't we take a break and we will come back

209
00:20:04,35 --> 00:20:10,69
and we'll figure out how interacting is the is the pater good idea let's listen to someone still loves you Boris

210
00:20:10,70 --> 00:20:13,49
Yeltsin This one's in pairs on RTRFM 92.1.

211
00:20:15,81 --> 00:20:25,99
This week on Talk the talk we guessing is stuck into what actually takes place in order for language acquisition in

212
00:20:26,00 --> 00:20:33,72
children to take a tick upwards so the big story here is that it's not just the number of words that you throw at a kid

213
00:20:34,03 --> 00:20:37,70
the assumed reason but it's the back

214
00:20:37,71 --> 00:20:44,33
and forth the turn taking the number of interactions this was a really good predictor of vocabulary development

215
00:20:44,34 --> 00:20:45,25
and language development

216
00:20:45,29 --> 00:20:50,47
and I'm assuming that's what Rachel is going to be getting into in this bracket of the conversation that is correct

217
00:20:50,48 --> 00:20:57,63
Rachel Romeo of MIT so I talked to her about the second phase of research where they actually got kids to wear

218
00:20:57,64 --> 00:20:58,30
recorders

219
00:20:58,31 --> 00:21:04,33
and taped everything that was going on around them so that was what we were really interested in was which aspects of

220
00:21:04,34 --> 00:21:12,57
the language environment these kids' language experience was most linked to the brain activation so what we did it is

221
00:21:12,58 --> 00:21:14,05
after kids did the act M.R.I.

222
00:21:14,27 --> 00:21:21,34
Study we send them home with these little recorders they're called Lena devices it stands for language environment

223
00:21:21,35 --> 00:21:22,14
and now it's that

224
00:21:22,54 --> 00:21:28,96
and it's a little recorder about the size of your palm maybe even smaller weighs a couple of ounces

225
00:21:29,20 --> 00:21:31,79
and it can hold up to sixteen hours of audio

226
00:21:31,83 --> 00:21:37,10
and we put them in little specialized short pockets that kids were right on the front of their chests

227
00:21:37,38 --> 00:21:40,88
and we ask parents to turn it on first thing in the morning when the kids woke up

228
00:21:40,89 --> 00:21:43,41
and record all the way till they went to that it night

229
00:21:43,84 --> 00:21:49,64
and we asked them to do this for two full days to get a big sample of their language environment and then

230
00:21:49,65 --> 00:21:57,02
when they returned to us the recorders we have each processing algorithms that that listen to that entire audio file

231
00:21:57,24 --> 00:22:03,89
and parse the part the parts of their day that worse each verse says other things like electronic noise like T.V.

232
00:22:04,42 --> 00:22:08,85
Versus noise or silence and then come the speech part of the day it

233
00:22:08,86 --> 00:22:15,17
and then further parse as that into what was spoken by an adult what was spoken by another.

234
00:22:15,36 --> 00:22:20,15
Child in their environment and what was spoken by the child actually wearing the recorders

235
00:22:20,42 --> 00:22:25,91
and so we have three main output measures we were interested in the amount of adult speech

236
00:22:25,95 --> 00:22:32,14
and the number of words spoken by an adult in the child's environment the amount of speech the child who's wearing the

237
00:22:32,15 --> 00:22:35,33
recorder the one of interactive actually saying

238
00:22:35,66 --> 00:22:42,23
and then are really interesting measure with what we call conversational terms so this is a time lock to discourse

239
00:22:42,24 --> 00:22:43,29
between an adult

240
00:22:43,30 --> 00:22:48,97
and the child wearing the recorder so within a specific amount of time you know the adult says something

241
00:22:48,98 --> 00:22:53,79
and the child responds that counts as a turn or vice versa that a child can say something

242
00:22:53,80 --> 00:22:59,05
and then the adult response and that counts as a turn and so then we looked at these measures

243
00:22:59,06 --> 00:23:02,90
and saw to try to find out which one was most linked to the brain response

244
00:23:03,32 --> 00:23:11,29
and it turned out to be the conversational terms so that kind of went against this thirty million word gap story that

245
00:23:11,30 --> 00:23:19,02
it's all about the sheer volume of speech that adults say to kids it really seemed to be more about the interactive

246
00:23:19,03 --> 00:23:25,18
component Now why would that be the case I think I can understand why that would happen

247
00:23:25,19 --> 00:23:27,39
but why would the number of back

248
00:23:27,40 --> 00:23:34,91
and forth the conversational turns be a better predictor of vocabulary size than the input the kids get to have any

249
00:23:34,92 --> 00:23:43,51
ideas yeah so there's been some theory for a long time that language actually evolved from.

250
00:23:44,54 --> 00:23:52,63
More primitive social parts of the brain so these non-verbal communicative social response piece things

251
00:23:53,01 --> 00:23:58,23
and that turn taking a ball before we even started to speak

252
00:23:58,51 --> 00:24:05,13
and so we really think it has something to do with the more social aspect of the language

253
00:24:05,41 --> 00:24:12,67
and also the fact that conversational turns provide sort of a feedback loop between the child

254
00:24:12,68 --> 00:24:15,36
and an adult so I can talk to my child.

255
00:24:15,43 --> 00:24:21,57
All day long just dumping language on top of them but they may not actually be processing math

256
00:24:21,85 --> 00:24:28,42
but if they're responding in conversing with me we create sort of this feedback loop between each other where they're

257
00:24:28,43 --> 00:24:35,42
getting to practice their language they're getting feedback from me on you know that's a good utterance I understand

258
00:24:35,43 --> 00:24:36,42
what you're saying

259
00:24:36,69 --> 00:24:42,82
and then at the same time I'm learning to hone my speech to their level so we call that the zone of proximal

260
00:24:42,83 --> 00:24:48,91
development that you know I have a two year old so I'm going to talk to them like a two year old media even two

261
00:24:48,92 --> 00:24:52,12
and a half year old but I'm not going to talk to them like a one year old

262
00:24:52,34 --> 00:24:59,73
or a twenty year old so it's sort of creates this feedback between US This really reminds me a lot of things that I've

263
00:24:59,74 --> 00:25:05,31
read about how people acquire a second language that you can give them all the input you want

264
00:25:05,35 --> 00:25:10,96
but input doesn't turn into intake unless there's some sort of interaction

265
00:25:10,97 --> 00:25:18,91
or component that makes you focus on what is being said I think that's why I gree with you that's why people say the

266
00:25:18,92 --> 00:25:21,46
best way to learn a language is to go to a country

267
00:25:21,47 --> 00:25:26,09
and just immerse yourself in it because you have to use it to interact

268
00:25:26,10 --> 00:25:32,86
and get by if I just listen to you know an audio stream of someone talking in different languages I'm not going to

269
00:25:32,87 --> 00:25:40,47
learn it because I don't have to use it OK Well that makes sense so let me just to be clear see if I understand what

270
00:25:40,48 --> 00:25:48,63
we're talking about the child for a really small child these turns could be something like the child babbles

271
00:25:48,64 --> 00:25:56,59
indistinctly so that the fascinating part about it is that turn taking can take different forms at different ages that

272
00:25:56,60 --> 00:26:03,73
the child so we look at preschool kids so these kids are capable of carrying on a conversation albeit simple you know

273
00:26:03,74 --> 00:26:11,70
they're not going to debate philosophy with you to a thirty five we can we can carry on an East that discourse right

274
00:26:11,71 --> 00:26:15,34
turn taking can occur in infant where.

275
00:26:15,36 --> 00:26:18,27
They can babble and you can make noises back

276
00:26:18,48 --> 00:26:26,28
or even say words back like you're probably molding your child's utterances So if they say cheese you might say yes

277
00:26:26,29 --> 00:26:33,22
that is cheese or it isn't these delicious you know back ounces a turn but even with even younger

278
00:26:33,23 --> 00:26:37,48
and friends who aren't even making sounds yet you can T.

279
00:26:37,49 --> 00:26:41,64
Turns nonverbally by making faces at each other or Koos

280
00:26:41,65 --> 00:26:50,86
or raspberries you know these things are turns to kids love to be able to exchange information in that way they get

281
00:26:50,87 --> 00:26:57,69
great joy out of realizing that you're tuned into what they're doing and you're sort of exchanging information

282
00:26:57,79 --> 00:27:01,60
and this is what I did a lot when my young one was small she would babble indistinctly

283
00:27:01,61 --> 00:27:04,73
and then I would go on like I understood what she was saying

284
00:27:05,18 --> 00:27:07,34
and then she would babble some more so that's a that's a back

285
00:27:07,35 --> 00:27:11,43
and forth that absolutely you're taking turns That's kind of amazing Now

286
00:27:11,73 --> 00:27:18,69
when you get a result like this of course you want to start thinking about other things like confounding factors is it

287
00:27:18,70 --> 00:27:25,52
possible to conversational turns are standing in for something else like with the thirty million word gap we had this

288
00:27:25,53 --> 00:27:30,93
idea that maybe parents that have the time they probably are more well off

289
00:27:30,94 --> 00:27:36,85
and so your parents who are a little wealthier their kids are going to have a better shot is it possible that this is

290
00:27:36,86 --> 00:27:43,90
happening here too like conversational turns happen when you can take time to have face to face discussion

291
00:27:43,91 --> 00:27:45,72
or face to face interaction

292
00:27:46,42 --> 00:27:51,39
and parents who can give lots of face to face time probably have lots of other resources to

293
00:27:51,60 --> 00:27:57,83
and maybe this is really what's driving language acquisition could that be possible we were worried about you know the

294
00:27:57,84 --> 00:28:02,00
ones we saw the link between conversational turns and both brain activity

295
00:28:02,04 --> 00:28:10,07
and children's language skills we then had to run a series of tests to make sure that it wasn't something else driving.

296
00:28:10,80 --> 00:28:18,85
So we needed some statistical modeling and control. Where the armory is socio economic status.

297
00:28:19,55 --> 00:28:24,01
Their income and the amount of education that parents had

298
00:28:24,05 --> 00:28:32,53
and once we got rid of the variance to the as yet we still saw this really strong link with conversational turn it was

299
00:28:32,58 --> 00:28:35,60
still driving kids knowledge of language

300
00:28:35,61 --> 00:28:42,06
and their brain activity we looked for a few other things too because this part of the brain seems to be so involved in

301
00:28:42,07 --> 00:28:50,22
other things other types of cognition we also controlled for kids executive functioning abilities their non-verbal

302
00:28:50,23 --> 00:28:56,31
calmness and even their language skills per se that didn't seem to be driving at ease there

303
00:28:56,70 --> 00:29:04,63
and finally we thought OK let's double check that it's not just the amount of language that's driving Mrs Wow And so

304
00:29:04,64 --> 00:29:09,71
even controlled for the number of words they heard spoken by an adult

305
00:29:10,01 --> 00:29:16,95
and even how much the child spoke themselves we didn't want to be a child driven variable controlling for all of these

306
00:29:16,96 --> 00:29:17,37
things

307
00:29:17,38 --> 00:29:26,00
and still seem to be extremely driven by conversational turns so it really seems to suggest that over a number people's

308
00:29:26,04 --> 00:29:26,99
social status

309
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:35,49
or their abilities to provide high quality preschool are things like that that there is this a fact of just a simple

310
00:29:35,50 --> 00:29:40,26
turn taking Rachel Romeo of MIT talking about turn taking

311
00:29:40,27 --> 00:29:47,40
and how it helps child language acquisition talk to your key that's it isn't it sweet really is

312
00:29:47,41 --> 00:29:52,76
but like don't talk at them talk with your kids how's that have good back and forth

313
00:29:53,28 --> 00:30:02,13
and look parents on key bends here he understands it can be really boring a lot of the time

314
00:30:02,14 --> 00:30:07,26
and cut like you can be something some of the some of the some of the conversations that we're going to have with you

315
00:30:07,53 --> 00:30:11,48
over and over and over again of going to be really boring

316
00:30:11,49 --> 00:30:17,52
but you just keep on truckin here's the other thing right we've talked about joint attention focusing joint attention

317
00:30:17,53 --> 00:30:19,35
on something like I'm looking at a thing

318
00:30:19,36 --> 00:30:25,11
and I'm saying hey look can you see that up can you see this one this is something that's very no way from this one

319
00:30:25,29 --> 00:30:31,87
it's the devil this is something that's very human very language other animals don't seem to try to direct others

320
00:30:31,97 --> 00:30:35,88
and all the tension with their utterances we notice things together

321
00:30:35,89 --> 00:30:40,74
and this is something that seems to be one of those human things one of those language things so it all ties up

322
00:30:40,75 --> 00:30:41,12
together

323
00:30:41,21 --> 00:30:47,71
and this is something that any parent can do indeed Yes So this is what I was saying before so like if you like super

324
00:30:47,72 --> 00:30:48,89
rich you talk in the U.S.

325
00:30:49,11 --> 00:30:54,70
So just talk to the kids give them some face time now this is part of a much longer interview with Rachael Romeo

326
00:30:54,71 --> 00:31:00,28
and that whole interview is up even now on patriotic we talk about what's going on in the children's brains

327
00:31:00,68 --> 00:31:07,14
and who's getting it right when it comes to theories about language acquisition is that Noam Chomsky in the nativists

328
00:31:07,15 --> 00:31:15,08
or is it the social interaction ists so check that out well what do you think I think that I need to spend the next

329
00:31:15,09 --> 00:31:20,71
song thinking all of the things to talk to my son about OK let's do and we'll listen to grave

330
00:31:20,72 --> 00:31:30,75
and her stuff I turn my face to the forest floor on RTRFM 92.1. Hey hey oh oh a.

331
00:31:31,60 --> 00:31:36,26
Oh oh I got some words for you was got some words and they come

332
00:31:36,27 --> 00:31:41,38
and through some words that fly in all of us it's time for a word of the week

333
00:31:41,99 --> 00:31:47,54
and in freestyle it well I had the first I didn't have a second run you know sometimes I just go with it I didn't

334
00:31:47,55 --> 00:31:56,37
notice a thing oh hey so what's the way to the way it is all we got three three whole was slow down just slow we've

335
00:31:56,38 --> 00:32:03,21
been going to us a few days been a trio of words for several weeks in a row it's just an avalanche of cavalcade a

336
00:32:03,37 --> 00:32:11,79
phantasmagoria but those aren't the three words the first word is awesome how is awesome a way to the way that you

337
00:32:11,80 --> 00:32:19,59
and others hang on I do not feel like have we strayed from what way to the way it is supposed to be because I recall

338
00:32:19,63 --> 00:32:25,26
one of the wake once upon a time in the health days of the show's youth was like he's a new

339
00:32:25,43 --> 00:32:32,24
and interesting word these days or some or some Sometimes we focus on words because they're new

340
00:32:32,25 --> 00:32:37,99
and sometimes we focus on them because they're the subject of some discussion in the linguistic world so how is

341
00:32:38,00 --> 00:32:46,52
or some changed it up a tweet by Neil de Grasse Tyson generally or some person generally yes a very smart dude but

342
00:32:46,53 --> 00:32:47,58
when it comes to.

343
00:32:49,39 --> 00:32:56,35
Really just doesn't seem to get it here's a tweet in my day can I just break you like a pause

344
00:32:56,98 --> 00:33:04,78
when you start a sentence with in my day there is a ninety eight percent chance the thing you're about to say is going

345
00:33:04,79 --> 00:33:12,02
to make you look like a jet so here it is in my day the word awesome was reserved for things like curing polio

346
00:33:12,03 --> 00:33:15,81
and was he's doing this appellative thing not for food or T.V.

347
00:33:16,05 --> 00:33:23,68
Shows OK Well first of all clearly he has never seen the while all Firefly I know because how you would not apply that

348
00:33:23,69 --> 00:33:28,29
word to either of those pieces of television just breaks my bright side. Second of all.

349
00:33:30,27 --> 00:33:36,88
Get off of his lawn there's something that just about everybody knows these days the word has gotten out

350
00:33:36,92 --> 00:33:43,84
and that is that language changes what everybody knows this is not new to Grasse Tyson apparently Certainly not I mean

351
00:33:43,85 --> 00:33:44,25
when you even

352
00:33:44,26 --> 00:33:50,56
when you have the most crinkly crusty sort of language scrolled writing they now have to include some sort of

353
00:33:50,57 --> 00:33:52,85
disclaimer like no I know that language changes

354
00:33:53,63 --> 00:33:59,65
and I don't like it they simply have to say something like that they have to mean so that's progress

355
00:34:00,14 --> 00:34:06,10
but in response Merriam Webster Yes a love

356
00:34:06,11 --> 00:34:12,86
when dictionary rices who don't get enough opportunity to be sassy get sassy they got sassy they just tweeted one word

357
00:34:13,36 --> 00:34:19,93
Neal that was it as in they want him to need you know they were like We need to talk all.

358
00:34:23,81 --> 00:34:30,71
Good shade so now here's a chance to talk about the history of awesome in the fifty ninety's ninety's

359
00:34:31,24 --> 00:34:36,57
and it goes back a lot further than I thought yes I'm pulling this from the online animal a dictionary Adam Online dot

360
00:34:36,58 --> 00:34:38,52
com We support them on patriotic

361
00:34:38,61 --> 00:34:44,88
and you should too the word meant profoundly reverential like it's the kind of thing that instills all well no even

362
00:34:44,89 --> 00:34:51,27
before then it was like a feeling of being humbled at the sublime then by the time we got to the sixteenth seventies

363
00:34:51,28 --> 00:34:58,77
then it meant inspiring all OK So sitting by yourself in a quiet reverential place was originally awesome

364
00:34:58,78 --> 00:34:59,62
and all you like

365
00:34:59,63 --> 00:35:06,91
but then awesome feeling meant Wow Going into a cathedral right by one thousand nine hundred sixty one awesome meant

366
00:35:06,92 --> 00:35:08,34
impressive or really good

367
00:35:08,56 --> 00:35:13,88
and I remember hearing it like around one nine hundred eighty it was a funny thing because about one hundred eighty two

368
00:35:14,12 --> 00:35:16,26
eighty three awesome was getting kind of big

369
00:35:16,88 --> 00:35:21,40
and then it vanished what absolutely disappeared from seeing it wasn't cool to say

370
00:35:21,50 --> 00:35:27,45
and then it came roaring back in the two thousands and I've thought yeah I've just never made any time

371
00:35:27,46 --> 00:35:32,00
when Olsen isn't just a word to describe a good thing I think that people who are smart

372
00:35:32,04 --> 00:35:36,54
and well known in their fields often think that they're good at everything

373
00:35:37,03 --> 00:35:41,08
and they're not until this is why I don't speak about astrophysics

374
00:35:41,19 --> 00:35:47,67
or indeed very much one one of the reasons why you don't speak about astrophysics you know one thing that I've noticed

375
00:35:47,68 --> 00:35:52,73
about language is that people are lousy at knowing what they actually do they claimed not to do the things that they

376
00:35:52,74 --> 00:36:01,72
actually do do I wonder if Neil de Grasse Tyson has ever used the word all this not you you eat you deep dive to yes I

377
00:36:01,73 --> 00:36:05,22
did but you know what about that if you did use the word awesome it to be about space

378
00:36:05,23 --> 00:36:12,19
or something really awesome Here's the tweet. This room two thousand and thirteen.

379
00:36:12,98 --> 00:36:21,75
Neil de Grasse Tyson multipath will multiply ball ping pong match between two octopuses would be awesome to watch look

380
00:36:21,75 --> 00:36:22,77
look.

381
00:36:23,06 --> 00:36:31,85
Really he's not awesome he's absolutely not wrong he's just wrong by his metric well tell you why in my day it was.

382
00:36:30,25 --> 00:36:31,52
polio and T.V.

383
00:36:34,08 --> 00:36:42,28
Like I want to have number to Anglo-Saxon I have to learn a little bit about this just recently really hold on there

384
00:36:42,29 --> 00:36:49,64
because I'm going to get you to tell me so Optus advertised a job on the seat dot com for someone to work in their city

385
00:36:49,65 --> 00:36:56,47
locations and they said prefer all know candidates who are Anglo-Saxon Oh and live near to neutral

386
00:36:56,48 --> 00:37:06,53
but I just I'm surprised because I'm relatively certain that's very illegal isn't it it is simply yes the office pulled

387
00:37:06,54 --> 00:37:07,03
the ad

388
00:37:07,04 --> 00:37:14,67
and they're investigating who it was that posted the THAT'S AMAZING SO sorry that's all for that is really really awful

389
00:37:14,68 --> 00:37:22,00
but it's amazing that that happened there is a reason why there are anti-racism there's an Equal Opportunity Commission

390
00:37:22,15 --> 00:37:29,87
whose sole job is what you just did wrong so I thought it would be a good chance to talk about the Anglo Saxons Oh yeah

391
00:37:29,88 --> 00:37:33,94
a Who where they really well the angles or the angles

392
00:37:34,08 --> 00:37:44,08
and the Saxons with two different genetic tribes that came to the east coast of the British Isles starting from I think

393
00:37:44,12 --> 00:37:47,95
about three or four hundred. For ten C.E.

394
00:37:48,22 --> 00:37:53,42
when The last of the Romans left the British Isles exactly right so they rocked up there was a bunch of Picts

395
00:37:53,57 --> 00:37:56,35
and brittle bones and Celts there was a trouble

396
00:37:56,41 --> 00:38:04,82
and they were basically like that's nice you need to go away now because this is a house which they did what can I say

397
00:38:04,83 --> 00:38:07,37
what people really like sailing places

398
00:38:07,38 --> 00:38:12,52
and taking it off the hands of people who already have it the language they spoke is now called Old English

399
00:38:12,53 --> 00:38:19,35
and the rest is history as they say you know the Anglo Saxons left a lot of words for things we have about four

400
00:38:19,36 --> 00:38:22,79
thousand five hundred words about five thousand words left in English.

401
00:38:23,11 --> 00:38:29,58
But they're the important ones though yes Sun Moon Sun daughter child man wife

402
00:38:29,76 --> 00:38:33,27
and then there are a lot of words left by Vikings so I'm going to give you a test.

403
00:38:34,11 --> 00:38:39,33
Viking Anglo-Saxon or Viking these are words that grew up side by side wish

404
00:38:39,34 --> 00:38:46,37
and want which one is Anglo-Saxon wishes Anglo-Saxon correct about to rear a child

405
00:38:46,38 --> 00:38:50,20
or to raise a child which one is Anglo-Saxon RICE That's correct.

406
00:38:51,05 --> 00:38:55,10
Keep going I want to see if my system works wrath and anger.

407
00:38:56,65 --> 00:39:07,68
Is Norse That is correct them how about the hide versus the skin of an animal skin is Anglo-Saxon no skin is doing so

408
00:39:07,69 --> 00:39:12,67
well you can tell because it's got a skull beginning of Ali when you've got skirt

409
00:39:12,71 --> 00:39:21,13
and a shirt the SCO one is there since one last one dyke and ditch Dyke is Norse Dyke as I.

410
00:39:21,97 --> 00:39:28,69
Tell you what's your what's you know my system was just sibilance that the things this animal this she I called

411
00:39:28,70 --> 00:39:31,69
Anglo-Saxon and this things sounded more constant in T.

412
00:39:31,70 --> 00:39:37,64
and Guttural like Old Norse OK Well it certainly does work for sick and ill then because sick

413
00:39:38,42 --> 00:39:48,42
and ill is Norse our final word of the week comes from David asked still don't attempt you know him he's the letters.

414
00:39:45,95 --> 00:39:48,09
guy from letters and numbers on his B.S.

415
00:39:50,14 --> 00:39:58,64
Knows his words what does he bring to us table of the word sinner Nim's thin in him you've heard of synonym of course

416
00:39:58,65 --> 00:40:03,39
and Antonyms these are thinner Nim's the words that are kind of small

417
00:40:03,40 --> 00:40:10,45
and you can tell them because they're often used in headlines synonyms Can you give me an example like for example in

418
00:40:10,46 --> 00:40:19,01
headlines people don't compete they compete No they vibe all other I'm sure very much wristing nothing ever annoys

419
00:40:19,02 --> 00:40:27,80
anyone it irks them and people never reckon. Mend something they hold on I can do this push now I know that's good.

420
00:40:29,14 --> 00:40:40,09
Counsel recommends Action Council suggests that's too long yes a feeling isn't Kelso on our urge for urges

421
00:40:40,35 --> 00:40:47,53
and I have contributed another one dog as in accusation dogs mayor yet right it sort of follows or yeah.

422
00:40:48,94 --> 00:40:51,98
I like that one because then you can think of accusation dogs.

423
00:40:52,72 --> 00:40:59,36
Rough life what else what other theme in the you think of fair listeners because I have a feeling that Al listenership

424
00:40:59,37 --> 00:41:06,58
is going to rock this competition I'm going to put it is at least five people who are listening to this already

425
00:41:06,59 --> 00:41:08,75
furiously grabbing like pen and paper

426
00:41:09,09 --> 00:41:12,69
and writing down all of the ones that have been sitting in their head this whole time anyway because they've been

427
00:41:12,70 --> 00:41:14,76
noticing it because that's the kind of people that are listening

428
00:41:15,54 --> 00:41:21,02
and if you would like to find out more about such people you can head to our Facebook page where all of these people

00:41:23,58 --> 00:41:29,92

433
00:41:46,00 --> 00:41:48,80
Dale on Facebook and a comment on our last show

434
00:41:48,81 --> 00:41:54,80
and said Hey I just listening to the new episode on the larynx there's a moment of misspeaking the numbers for how

435
00:41:54,81 --> 00:42:01,75
often a vocal folds a vibration be per second not per minute also to look calls the diaphragm an imaginary line I don't

436
00:42:01,85 --> 00:42:03,45
want to get too technical for the listeners

437
00:42:03,46 --> 00:42:09,14
but I think it's a little too a majestic it's a muscle Dale teaches actors in vocal health

438
00:42:09,15 --> 00:42:16,68
and speech at the Stella Adler studio of acting we really do try to stress the accuracy so thanks for that Dale Mike

439
00:42:17,21 --> 00:42:19,94
asks just thinking about your conversation about babies

440
00:42:19,95 --> 00:42:24,10
and how they recognize all languages does this help support Chomsky and his ideas of universal grammar

441
00:42:24,43 --> 00:42:29,17
and they say that this does support a weak version of the Chomskian view that humans are born with a language ready

442
00:42:29,18 --> 00:42:35,03
brain however if you're not a believer in Chomsky nativism which I'm not then you could say we have brains that are

443
00:42:35,04 --> 00:42:38,16
good for looking at patterns language patterns and other patterns

444
00:42:38,17 --> 00:42:43,00
and language use the same neural architecture that we use for everything else there doesn't have to be a specific

445
00:42:43,01 --> 00:42:45,70
module for language in the human brain.

446
00:42:46,70 --> 00:42:51,84
I'm afraid that's all we've got time for but Andrew's question on why we call children kids

447
00:42:52,33 --> 00:42:58,27
and also Carl's question about Google eggs we're going to tackle that one next time thanks very much for listening

448
00:42:58,31 --> 00:43:00,59
and until next time keep talking.
